She learned why from her father, a molecular scientist: wool contains lanolin, which mimics the hydrating oils of human skin. After years of working in beauty, and countless chapped lips & tubes of every balm imaginable, Kirsten knew that when it comes to moisturising & healing skin, you can’t improve on lanolin. She created LANO, a lanolin-based skincare line, using the highest quality lanolin sourced (cruelty-free) from Australian farmers and their sheep - as the most natural answer to dry skin. With lanolin, your skin has literally met its match.</p>",
